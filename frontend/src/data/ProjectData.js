                    "While creating projects that relied on procedural generation within the Java-based backend, it became apparent that much of the repeated code could be reused under a specified range-based class. However, when looking for such an external library to use, all of the available options proved to be limited. In fact, while attempting to build upon these external libraries to meet the needs of the projects, the code just ended up becoming quite convoluted - especially when working with multi-ranges. As such, I set out to craft my own library that streamlined the use of ranges; and, while the original use case for this library was procedural generation, any programming working with highly complex RNG could benefit from its use.",
                    "The core of the library is focused on the abstract Range class, which has two concrete subclasses of SingleRange and MultiRange - with the MultiRange class being composed of multiple SingleRange instances. By having the abstract Range class, any use cases for a range can be built without having to worry about any conflicts between the two subclasses - whether single or multi. This is because the single and multi-range classes handle the same method calls slightly differently, but the programs using them only need to know that it is a range - a great case of a blackbox. Additionally, when creating a multi-range based on multiple single-ranges, the class constructor will create a union to remove any overlaps that occur - increasing efficiency upon method calls to the instances.",
                    "Getting further into the details, it must be understood that in order to create a range, the expected order of elements must be understood. This is because a range truly only has start and end points, and does not store the values in between. As such, there are Orderable and Oderator classes to help with this, which allow a user to create a custom set of rules of ordering for their own classes. However, this would be quite frustrating to do with primitive data types, such as integers. As such, there are static factory methods that help to construct ranges for the wrapper classes of primitive data types - as well as for enums. By doing so, a user only has to call the factory method and provide start and end points for the range, without having to create or provide their own Orderator. However, as previously alluded to, creating instances of the Orderator interface will allow you to also use any custom classes within ranges, as well.",
                    "As with other data structures, this library allows us to determine the size of the range, the index that a value would be within a range, whether the range contains a specific value, and many more. Additionally, both single and multi-ranges are iterable via the Java standard library Iterable interface. However, more range-specific methods are also included, such as unions and intersections, along with other various methods such as creating splices of ranges before and after certain values.",
                    "A great example of the use of this library is the Block Breaker project - also found within this portfolio - which uses procedural generation in order to create character descriptions. Due to the extensive amount of factors used for the procedural generation within the project, dozens of ranges had to be used - thus, helping to save an extensive amount of time, and significantly reducing repeated code."

To do this, it attempts to solve two problems within one app. The first is that it removes the need for extensive spreadsheets, which are heavily used by game studios in order to store and collaborate on information. However, as these spreadsheets grow, they can often become hard to navigate. The Koala Toolkit fixes this issue by allowing the data to easily be editable and maintainable through the app, and scaling to your needs. The second problem is that it is often very hard to switch from one coding language to another after starting the process of coding a game. As such, the Koala Toolkit auto-generates the code for the user in their programming language of choice. So, even if other parts outside of character creation still need to be rewritten, the core code for characters is just a few clicks away.",

They are given a variety of ways in which they can customize the moves, as well as being capable of adding a description. Additionally, users are also able to create characters, who can be given their own attributes and descriptions, along with any combat moves that have already been created within the project. Finally, as necessary, users may be able to download the project - or, if needed, only part of the project - in a variety of formats. These include both spreadsheets and JSON files, as well as code files in a variety of languages - such as C#, Python, Java, and Dart."

                    "The game engine presented in this project was personally crafted entirely from the ground up - from the execution of the game loop and the rendering of its graphics, to the UI objects and their interactions. The lone exception to this was the creation of the program window itself, as this was handled by the Java standard library. However, all interactions with this window - as well as rendering and display - were done by the game engine's own code, and not from any other internal or external libraries. Additionally, while still rudimentary, the game engine provides all necessary capabilities needed for a simple game loop, UI system, and game objects.",
                    "As such, this project represents a strong example of attempting to understand the game logic that occurs deep behind the scenes of video games, and to then emulate this same logic when crafting the engine. It's a knowledge and understanding that would simply not be possible by only using a readily available game engine, such as Unreal, Unity, or Godot. As such, my own knowledge of video games was greatly strengthened due to working at the very base of video game production.",
                    "The game engine itself is intended to be downloaded as a library, or used as module that the game is dependent upon. As it currently stands, the development of the engine is still in the earlier stages. However, as previously mentioned, there is still a large amount of depth currently within the project - with everything being built from the ground up. The interactions take place in Theatres, where the objects placed into them are divided into being either GameObjects or UIObjects - with GameObjects being placed directly into the Theatres themselves, while the UIObjects are overlaid onto the screen. In fact, this separation of GameObject and UIObject objects also makes it much easier to also use the engine purely for its UI elements, such as building an app - with much of the UI design being based on the principles of web design itself.",

Not only is it used to demonstrate one's own skills, knowledge, and aptitudes, but also their work ethos and personality. As such, I have put in considerable time in order to ensure that my website clearly reflects who I am as a programmer - with attention paid to small details, and a cohesive sci-fi-ish aesthetic.",
                    "You will note that each of the pages has a navigation bar at the top that is aesthetically simple so as to not intrude upon the actual pages themselves. The navigation bar's use of the same background color as the actual pages makes for a seamless look, which is only broken by a thin blue border. The specific page that you are currently on will also cause its associated navigation button to be lit up on the navigation bar, while the others are darkened. The other navigation buttons will then slightly brighten upon hovering, but not to the level of the button for the current page - so as to maintain the necessary distinction. The pages themselves then each also share a gradient background that goes from near black to a dark very blue. This, especially when paired with the star-like pattern in the background, provides a sort of cosmic feel to each page.",
                    "The landing page is simple in order to drive the focus to the featured projects, which are each placed inside of hexagon-shaped containers and then arranged in a honeycomb pattern. The use of only logos for each project here is intended to reduce the appearance of clutter that would come if each project's title was readily available - as well as for other details. However, upon hovering over a featured project, the title of the given project does then become displayed in order to bring focus to it - which is then further aided by other small details, such as a thicker border, a larger logo, and a shift in the background color of the container.",
                    "When visiting the projects page via the associated navigation bar button, you will then notice an increase in complexity - with various text, colors, and icons used throughout. This is because each project has a container that contains an overview of the features and characteristics for the given project, as it is important for others to be able to quickly distinguish between these features and characteristics. However, even with that said, an attempt at simplicity is still readily recognizable on this page. For example, each language and technology used by a project is still only represented by a white icon inside of a container that has a color associated with that feature. Those who know the feature will thus be able to quickly recognize it, without being overloaded by text. Additionally, for those who do not recognize the icons, hovering over the icon does create a popup to display the name of the associated feature. A similar attempt at icons was also made regarding the skills used for a given project. However, the lack of universal symbols for most of these would have created issues - and could have also possibly created an icon overload itself - so simplified naming conventions were used, instead. Other than that, the only text found inside of each project container is the title of the project itself. Finally, at the very top of page, the user is presented with a means for sorting and filtering through projects.",
                    "If one were to then click on either a featured project from the landing page or a project container from the projects page, you would then be taken to the individual project page for that specific project - with each project having a specific ID that can be found in its URL. Once here, you will notice many of the same details that have already been noted beforehand, with the project title, logo, skills, languages, and technologies all being present - though accompanied by headers. However, in addition to these previous details, there is also an abstract for each project, links to both GitHub repositories and live versions of each project, and a description of the project (such as the one that you have been reading). Each description is then provided as a means for breaking down the most important elements of each project, while also providing some insight into my own thoughts and design process. In the top-left corner of each page is then a button to quickly return to the projects page - even if having come from the landing page, direct link, or otherwise.",
                    "The last two pages are then quite simple. The about page provides a quick blurb about my work ethos and background, while also listing all relevant languages and technologies that I am adept at using. As with the other pages, there is an attempt at simplicity. However, because the emphasis is now specifically on my skillset, each language and technology is shown via a larger and more complete logo. Finally, the contact page allows for an easy means of contacting me via a simple message form directly built into the website itself. That being said, if the information is incomplete - or an email is formatted incorrectly - then error messages that have been individualized for each input field will appear upon clicking the submit button. However, in order to maintain the simplified and unassuming aesthetic of the website, the overall appearance of the color red was minimized for warnings, by only having it shown on the left border of the errored field, along with the small red warning icon. Lastly, the submit button was designed in a simple - yet dynamic - manner, by having its underlined appearance shift to a complete background upon hovering over the button."

                    "FieldSense is a node-based system that allows for objects to not only understand their environment from a spatial perspective, but also from a contextual and descriptive perspective. In essence, this would mean that not only could the A.I. in the game manuever around the environment from Point A to Point B, but that they could essentially describe the environment around themselves as they pass from Point A to Point B. A bard could know that the leaves of the tree are red, or that the grass is wet, and sing a fabulous tale about the actual journey in detail. It could sense that a bird is chirping, or a squirrel is eating. While a relatively small subset of games fudge the previous examples as cute points of interaction within given locations, the fact that they only occur in these set locations makes them static, rather than dynamic. You can only do it at precise locations, and the types of relationships to the possible interaction are also static. It is because of this static nature that it would be impossible to dynamically create a scavenger hunt for players to do. Scavenger hunts are about riddles. To make a riddle for an environment, there needs to be a system that can intelligently describe not only objects, but how they relate to the other objects around them. In fact, if you want any procedurally-generated task or quest to feel authentic, then the environment must be authentically understood. Introducing FieldSence.",
                    "This is done by establishing each object defined within the FieldSense system as being a node, and then establishing parameters by which they can be described. This is especially helpful for procedurally generating descriptions of an environment in a more dynamic. In fact, other systems that procedurally generate maps either focus on the spatial perspective (i.e., the most simple versions being mazes), or reduce themselves to very general static concepts which state that people live in a given constructed town and a cave was built specifically because we want a quest to be built there. However, outside of these static parameters defined by the algorithm that generated the actual map, there lacks a system that allows for either the world to be dynamically described, or for dynamic creation of tasks or quests who creation are based solely on the nodes of the objects/characters in the gameworld, rather than a static script of required quests.but also generate nodes that provide details for describing specific locations relative to others… this provides for storytelling elements, treasure hunts, etc."
