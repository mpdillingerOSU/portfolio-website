                    "FieldSense is a node-based system that allows for objects to not only understand their environment from a spatial perspective, but also from a contextual and descriptive perspective. In essence, this would mean that not only could the A.I. in the game manuever around the environment from Point A to Point B, but that they could essentially describe the environment around themselves as they pass from Point A to Point B. A bard could know that the leaves of the tree are red, or that the grass is wet, and sing a fabulous tale about the actual journey in detail. It could sense that a bird is chirping, or a squirrel is eating. While a relatively small subset of games fudge the previous examples as cute points of interaction within given locations, the fact that they only occur in these set locations makes them static, rather than dynamic. You can only do it at precise locations, and the types of relationships to the possible interaction are also static. It is because of this static nature that it would be impossible to dynamically create a scavenger hunt for players to do. Scavenger hunts are about riddles. To make a riddle for an environment, there needs to be a system that can intelligently describe not only objects, but how they relate to the other objects around them. In fact, if you want any procedurally-generated task or quest to feel authentic, then the environment must be authentically understood. Introducing FieldSence.",
                    "This is done by establishing each object defined within the FieldSense system as being a node, and then establishing parameters by which they can be described. This is especially helpful for procedurally generating descriptions of an environment in a more dynamic. In fact, other systems that procedurally generate maps either focus on the spatial perspective (i.e., the most simple versions being mazes), or reduce themselves to very general static concepts which state that people live in a given constructed town and a cave was built specifically because we want a quest to be built there. However, outside of these static parameters defined by the algorithm that generated the actual map, there lacks a system that allows for either the world to be dynamically described, or for dynamic creation of tasks or quests who creation are based solely on the nodes of the objects/characters in the gameworld, rather than a static script of required quests.but also generate nodes that provide details for describing specific locations relative to others… this provides for storytelling elements, treasure hunts, etc."
